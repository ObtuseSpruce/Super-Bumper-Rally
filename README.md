# Technologies used:
# Phaser: https://phaser.io/phaser3

# Approach:
# I made a racing game because that seemed like a doable gametype in Phaser. Unfortunately phaser breaks fairly easily outside the score of game types it was designed for. Given more time there is no doubt one could move outside these constraints but for a first game in Phaser a racing game proved more than challenging. Over all its fairly simple, get from one end of the race track to the other. However this involved several colliders adding collisions for all game objects and a rather brute forced way to restart the game as Phaser doesn't like to simply "restart scenes". A restarted game still gives me issues but I think its fixable I'm just not sure at the moment how.
